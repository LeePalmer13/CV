  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <h3>

    I live in Devon within the Dartmoor National Park. I started my working life as an apprentice vehicle engineer at the Army
    college based at Aborfield nr. Reading. After a 2 year course I had earned my City and Guilds level two and was sent, after
    a further brief vehicle equipment course, to Germany. After leaving the Army I held various roles throughout several local garages
    where due to poor health I was forced to re-skill.
    <br>
    <br>
    I have studied with The Open University for a little over 10 years and earned an M.A. in Classical Studies. The experience I have developed academically has between
    extremely valuable in both academic writing and research. Searching for further challenges I am studying Computer Science
    and Web Development. Although still new to the field I believe that I can make a valuable contribution to someone's
    web prescence through the use of my coding skills.
